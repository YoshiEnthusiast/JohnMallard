Discord arena bot

What is arena?
-------

- Arena is a way of holding tournaments for different online games

How it works:

- You can join and leave at any time
- You get automatically matched into other participants based on your rating
- When you get an opponent, a separate private Discord channel is created where you can report the winner by reacting to a message
- By winning, you increase your global rank and gain points which are dispayed in arena scoreboard. Starting from the winstreak of 3, you get 2 points for winning instead of 1. When the arena is finished, a winner is determined based on the number of points

Use the `help` command to get the list of all commands
